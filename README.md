# NeuralNetwork
Implementation of Neural network using sigmoid units and cross entropy loss on Iris and Connect-4 dataset. Also includes decision tree implementations.
* Iris Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
* Connect-4 Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connect-4

The Neural network algorithm is implemented only discrete inputs and attribute file having a specific structure. Kindly go through the examples of attribute files present to understand.
Please go through the ReadMe file in Learning-tusharku folder to understand how to execute the programs.
